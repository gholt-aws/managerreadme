The goal of concise writing is effective and efficient communication. Early drafts often have weak or unnecessary words that can be deleted or replaced. During the editing process writers should deliberately and ruthlessly eliminate any words that do not add meaning or impact. Concise writing does not always have the fewest words, but it always uses the strongest ones. The size and nature of the audience will inform the effort you should spend refining your writing. When only the most effective words remain, you show respect for your audience and their time - and are more likely to achieve your goals.

1. Replace several vague words with more powerful and specific words.

Often, writers use several small and ambiguous words to express a concept, wasting energy expressing ideas better relayed through fewer specific words. As a general rule, more specific words lead to more concise writing. Because of the variety of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, most things have a closely corresponding description. Brainstorming or searching a thesaurus can lead to the word best suited for a specific instance. Notice that the examples below actually convey more as they drop in word count.
