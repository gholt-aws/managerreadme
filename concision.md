The goal of concise writing is effective and efficient communication. Early drafts often have weak or unnecessary words that can be deleted or replaced. During the editing process writers should deliberately and ruthlessly eliminate any words that do not add meaning or impact. Concise writing does not always have the fewest words, but it always uses the strongest ones. The size and nature of the audience will inform the effort you should spend refining your writing. When only the most effective words remain, you show respect for your audience and their time - and are more likely to achieve your goals.

1. Replace several vague words with more powerful and specific words.

Often, writers use several small and ambiguous words to express a concept, wasting energy expressing ideas better relayed through fewer specific words. As a general rule, more specific words lead to more concise writing. Because of the variety of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, most things have a closely corresponding description. Brainstorming or searching a thesaurus can lead to the word best suited for a specific instance. Notice that the examples below actually convey more as they drop in word count.
Wordy: The politician talked about several of the merits of after-school programs in his speech

(14 words)
Concise: The politician touted after-school programs in his speech.

(8 words)
Wordy: Suzie believed but could not confirm that Billy had feelings of affection for her.

(14 words)
Concise: Suzie assumed that Billy adored her.

(6 words)
Wordy: Our Web site has made available many of the things you can use for making a decision on the best dentist.

(20 words)
Concise: Our website presents criteria for determining the best dentist.

(9 words)
Wordy: Working as a pupil under someone who develops photos was an experience that really helped me learn a lot.

(20 words)
Concise: Working as a photo technician's apprentice was an educational experience.

(10 words)
2. Interrogate every word in a sentence

Check every word to make sure that it is providing something important and unique to a sentence. If words are dead weight, they can be deleted or replaced. Other sections in this handout cover this concept more specifically, but there are some general examples below containing sentences with words that could be cut.
Wordy: The teacher demonstrated some of the various ways and methods for cutting words from my essay that I had written for class.

(22 words)
Concise: The teacher demonstrated methods for cutting words from my essay.

(10 words)
Wordy: Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood formed a new band of musicians together in 1969, giving it the ironic name of Blind Faith because early speculation that was spreading everywhere about the band suggested that the new musical group would be good enough to rival the earlier bands that both men had been in, Cream and Traffic, which people had really liked and had been very popular.

(66 words)
Concise: Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood formed a new band in 1969, ironically naming it Blind Faith because speculation suggested that the group would rival the musicians’ previous popular bands, Cream and Traffic.

(32 words)
Wordy: Many have made the wise observation that when a stone is in motion rolling down a hill or incline that that moving stone is not as likely to be covered all over with the kind of thick green moss that grows on stationary unmoving things and becomes a nuisance and suggests that those things haven’t moved in a long time and probably won’t move any time soon.

(67 words)
Concise: A rolling stone gathers no moss.

(6 words)
3. Combine Sentences.

Some information does not require a full sentence, and can easily be inserted into another sentence without losing any of its value. To get more strategies for sentence combining, see the handout on Sentence Variety.
Wordy: Ludwig's castles are an astounding marriage of beauty and madness. By his death, he had commissioned three castles.

(18 words)
Concise: Ludwig's three castles are an astounding marriage of beauty and madness.

(11 words)
Wordy: The supposed crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico aroused interest in extraterrestrial life. This crash is rumored to have occurred in 1947.

(24 words)
Concise: The supposed 1947 crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico aroused interest in extraterrestrial life.

Identifying and addressing wordiness in sentences

If you are a student, pay close attention to your instructors’ comments on your essays. Have they written things like “wordy,” “passive voice,” “filler” or “irrelevant”? By learning to write concisely, you will be able to fill your papers with more substantive information. Getting to the point promptly can help you become a clearer thinker and a more engaging writer.

Outside of school, writing concisely can help you create more effective business letters, email messages, memos, and other documents. Busy readers appreciate getting the information they need quickly and easily.

Here are some strategies to help you identify wordiness and decide whether, and how, to revise it. At times, you may choose to keep a sentence just as it is, even though there are more concise ways to express your idea: you might, for example, use repetition to emphasize a point or include a redundant pair of words (a subject we’re just about to discuss) to create a certain rhythm. What’s important is that you make a conscious choice.
1. Eliminate redundant pairs

When the first word in a pair has roughly the same meaning as the second, choose one.

Common examples of redundant pairs include: full and complete, each and every, hopes and dreams, whole entire, first and foremost, true and accurate, always and forever.

    Example: For each and every book you purchase, you will receive a free bookmark.

    Revision: For every book you purchase, you will receive a free bookmark.

2. Delete unnecessary qualifiers

Often we use qualifiers that really aren’t necessary to express our meaning (such as “really” in this sentence). By deleting unnecessary qualifiers, you can often eliminate one or two words per sentence. Tweaks like this may not seem like much, but they can add up.

Common qualifiers include: actually, really, basically, probably, very, definitely, somewhat, kind of, extremely, practically.

    Example: Because a great many of the words in this sentence are basically unnecessary, it would really be a very good idea to edit somewhat for conciseness.

    Revision: Because many of the words in this sentence are unnecessary, we should edit it.

3. Identify and reduce prepositional phrases

Overuse of prepositional phrases (which begin with words like “in,” “for,” “at,” “on,” “through,” and “over”) can make a sentence clunky and unclear. To locate this problem, circle the prepositions in your draft and see whether you can eliminate any prepositional phrases without losing your meaning. Sometimes the easiest way to revise a wordy sentence is to ask yourself “What do I really mean here?” and then write a new sentence; this approach can be more efficient than just tinkering with your existing sentence.

    Example: The reason for the failure of the basketball team of the University of North Carolina in the Final Four game against the team from Kansas was that on that day and at that time, some players were frequently unable to rebound the ball.

    Revision: UNC’s basketball team lost the Final Four game against Kansas because it could not consistently rebound the ball.

4. Locate and delete unnecessary modifiers

Sometimes the meaning of a word or phrase implies its modifier, making the modifier unnecessary.

    Example: Do not try to anticipate in advance those events that will completely revolutionize society.

In this example, “anticipate” already implies that something is in advance, and “revolutionize” already implies that something will be completely changed.

    Revision: Do not try to anticipate revolutionary events.

5. Replace a phrase with a word

Many commonly-used phrases can be replaced with single words. These phrases often crop up in writing that requires a formal tone, but they detract from, rather than add to, meaning.

“The reason for”, “due to the fact that”, “in light of the fact that”, “given the fact that”, and “considering the fact that” can be replaced with because, since, or why.

“In the event that” and “under circumstances in which” can be replaced with if.”It is necessary that” and “cannot be avoided” can be replaced with must or should.

“For the purpose of” can often be replaced with an infinitive verb (the “to ____” form of the verb).

    Example: In the event that going out for the purpose of eating with them cannot be avoided, it is necessary that we first go to the ATM, in light of the fact that I am out of cash.

    Revision: If we must go out to eat with them, we should first go to the ATM because I am out of cash.

For more examples of common phrases that can be replaced with a word, see the Writing Center’s handout on style.
6. Identify negatives and change them to affirmatives

Expressing ideas in negative form means you must use an extra word; it also makes readers work harder to figure out your meaning.

    Example: If you do not have more than five years of experience, do not call for an interview if you have not already spoken to human resources.

    Revision: Applicants with more than five years of experience can bypass human resources and call for an interview.

Passive voice

In an active sentence, the subject (the person or thing doing the action) comes first. In a passive sentence, the order of the words is different-the object (the thing that is receiving the action) comes first, and the subject appears at the end of the sentence or isn’t included at all. To spot the passive voice, look at the main verb of each sentence-if there’s a form of “be” (am, is, are, was, were) and a past tense verb (many end with -ed), the sentence may be passive. The passive voice is not a grammatical error, and it can be useful, especially in scientific writing. But writing in the passive voice often leads to using more words than necessary. Passive sentences can also frustrate or confuse your readers, who must wait patiently to find out who or what did the action of the sentence.

    Example: The 1780 constitution of Massachusetts was written by John Adams.

In this passive construction, the meaning of the sentence is clear, but there are more words than necessary. To make this sentence more concise, move the subject to the front and get rid of the “to be” verb (in this case, “was”).

    Revision: John Adams wrote the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution.

    Another example: The letter was taken to the mailbox by Sally.

    Revision: Sally took the letter to the mailbox.

Writing concise papers

Now that you know how to avoid wordiness at the sentence level, you may want to try some additional strategies to use the space in your papers efficiently.
Think about your argument

What is the thesis of your paper? What exactly are you trying to accomplish? And what components of your paper are necessary to prove your argument? In a thesis-driven essay, every part of your paper should be geared toward proving that argument. Sometimes this proof will come in the form of direct evidence supporting your thesis; other times you will be addressing counterarguments.

Every paragraph in your essay must have a purpose. When revising, critically examine each paragraph and ask yourself whether it is necessary to your overall thesis. You may decide to cut some paragraphs. This process could be painful, especially if you have done a lot of research you’d like to include or need more words to meet a page limit, but it will strengthen your paper.
Think about your audience

Not all types of writing are thesis-driven, but all writing has an intended audience. When writing, you should always have your readers in mind and consider what they need to know.

For example, when writing a paper for your psychology class on Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, you probably do not have to start by saying “Sigmund Freud is one of the most famous psychiatrists of all time.” In most college papers, you should imagine that your audience is composed of educated readers who are not taking your class and are not experts on your current topic. Most educated readers will know who Freud is and will not need such a general reminder.

For another example, when applying to the business school and working on your one-page resume, rather than using a small font and trying to include every job and activity you took part in, think about your audience and the information they will most need to evaluate your application.

Knowing how to write concisely will serve you well in many situations. For more information on writing concisely, please consult the works below.

Concise Writing: What Is It, and Why Does It Matter? Mira Khanna Updated on November 28, 2019

Have you ever lost interest while reading something long-winded and rambling? You aren’t alone.

Concise writing means using the fewest words possible to convey an idea clearly. There’s a reason why writing concisely is recommended so often—it’s excellent advice.

Here’s a tip: Want to make sure your writing is always clear and concise? Grammarly can help!
Concise writing is right around the corner.

Reading sprawling sentences can feel overwhelming, confusing, or boring. It can confuse readers by making it harder for them to quickly identify the main point of what you’re trying to communicate. After all, they have to sift through the extra verbiage and hunt for the key points of your message. Making readers do unnecessary work can make them grumpy, and grumpy readers are less receptive to what you have to say.

Whether you’re sending a text message, writing an email, or updating your resume, wordy writing dilutes the impact of your message. Concise writing, instead, helps grab and hold your reader’s attention. It’s also likely to be more memorable and make a lasting impact on your reader.

But brevity doesn’t come naturally to everyone, and concise writing takes effort. Here are some tips to help you identify the extra words weighing down your writing and tighten up unwieldy sentences.
Eliminate Redundant Words

Cutting redundant words like tautologies can help create stronger, more direct sentences. Tautologies are expressions or phrases that repeat the same information. They take up unnecessary space and can distract your reader. Getting rid of them simplifies sentences and gets your point across faster.

Wordy: In my opinion, I think that’s a problem.

Concise: In my opinion, that’s a problem.
Wordy: The course had several necessary requirements.

Concise: The course had several requirements.

Clear and Concise Writing with Grammarly
Strengthen Weak Adjectives

Using strong, descriptive adjectives helps trim down sentence length. Look for places where you’ve used two words to describe something when one would do. Strengthening your vocabulary can help you ensure that you’re using the best word for the situation and that all of your words deserve to be in your sentence. Plus, strong adjectives make your writing more vibrant!

Wordy: Brunch was very good.

Concise: Brunch was superb.
Wordy: She struggled to sit through his really boring speech.

Concise: She struggled to sit through his tedious speech.

Remove Vague Nouns

Do all of your nouns actually move your point forward? If not, it may be time to say goodbye. Eliminating these unnecessary words will help make your writing more direct and clear.

Wordy: Career growth was an important factor in why I decided to join.

Concise: I joined to advance my career.
Wordy: I’m interested in the areas of history and biology.

Concise: I’m interested in history and biology.

Eliminate Filler Words

Filler words are words that add no meaning or value to a sentence and simply “fill” the space. They can be easily removed or replaced, but often inadvertently creep up in writing since we’re so used to using them in our speech.

Wordy: For all intents and purposes, this project will be outsourced.

Concise: This project will be outsourced.
Wordy: Needless to say, I think we should get grilled cheese.

Concise: We should get grilled cheese.

Construct Active Sentences

Some sentence structures tend to be wordier than others. Although the passive voice isn’t incorrect and is completely fine to use in moderation, it’s often a weaker type of sentence construction. If you find yourself trending towards using the passive voice because you think it sounds a bit fancier or softens something unpleasant, remember that active voice sets a stronger and more direct tone. Keep most of your sentences in active voice—you’ll find that they also tend to be more concise.

Wordy: If this was something caused on our end, it might be something to be aware of.

Concise: We should be aware of this in case something on our end caused it.
Wordy: The error message was written by robots.

Concise: Robots wrote the error message.

It’s easy to fill up sentences with extra words, especially when you’re excited about what you have to say. Concise writing takes effort and can be tricky, but every word needs to earn its place in your writing.

And the good news is that you don’t have to do it alone. Did you know that Grammarly offers checks to identify tautologies, enhance your vocabulary, eliminate unnecessary phrases, and flag passive voice?

For many of us these days, our writing practice is limited to quick text messages, hasty tweets, and less-than-inspired Facebook statuses.

Now we can’t all be Pulitzer Prize-winning authors, but regardless of whether you’re writing a manuscript or an email to your boss, mastering the art of good writing can help you become a stronger, more effective communicator.
A Guide to Concise Writing

Please enjoy this exclusive excerpt from The Art of Writing, the ultimate guide to elegant and effective writing for every kind of writer.
Economy in Writing

Economy is a matter of using the fewest words to produce the most meaning. It is often the excess of words and ideas, not the lack of them, that dilutes the power of your writing.

When simplifying a sentence, it helps to follow a methodical process similar to mathematical proofing.

When mathematicians approach an equation, they attempt to solve it one step at a time, showing all their work in a logical, descending sequence. By applying the same technique, writers can take a structured approach to artistic writing.
Tip 1: Eliminate Crutch Words

Crutch words commonly manifest themselves in spoken English. Sometimes called “filler words,” crutch words are meaningless parcels of language that writers and speakers alike tend to inadvertently pepper across every sentence.

Artistic writers should be able to express themselves without the need for filler language. To write naturally is not to write carelessly, but to write in a way that best reflects your values, aspirations, and ideals. Crutch words rarely clarify or improve your writing, nor do they facilitate expression.
Examples

    Jaxon would definitely never do that.
    Jaxon would never do that.

    Macy actually didn’t know what was happening.
    Macy didn’t know what was happening.

    Richard literally never got tired of playing hockey.
    Richard never got tired of playing hockey. 

Tip 2: Avoid Repetition

A tautology is an unnecessary (and often unintentional) repetition of meaning. Tautologies, if not for rhetorical effect, must be avoided. They have no place in artistic writing.
Examples

    He was met with an unexpected surprise.
    He was met with a surprise. 

    Perhaps it will forever remain an unsolved mystery.
    Perhaps it will forever remain a mystery.

    It is estimated that two out of every one hundred people, or 2 percent of the world population, has green eyes.
    It is estimated that 2 percent of the world population has green eyes.

Tip 3: Write with Conviction

Qualifiers are words or phrases whose purpose is to limit or enhance an adjective or adverb’s meaning.

When used sparingly, qualifiers can improve the quality and precision of your message. However, qualifiers are often abused in writing, strewn across every sentence with the hope of creating a more nuanced piece of work.

Rather, the inclusion of too many qualifiers or weasel words is the ultimate token of the immature writer and signals a lack of conviction. Use qualifiers only when strictly necessary!
Examples

    It was a rather sunny day.
    It was a sunny day.

    He was quite tired.
    He was tired. 

If you think a qualifier is necessary for emphatic reasons, it may be better to change the qualified word entirely.

    The dessert was very tasty.
    The dessert was scrumptious.

Tip 4: Streamline Your Writing

Transition words create bridges between ideas in your writing, linking them together and strengthening their connections. These words are useful but must be employed heedfully and skillfully.

When used unnecessarily, transition words become pointless flourishes. Thus, writers should try to streamline their writing in such a way that each sentence leads naturally to the next, eliminating the need for transition words in most cases.
Examples

    Although writing is hard, mastery can be achieved with structured practice. Therefore, by consistently trying to improve your writing, you will become a better writer.
    Mastery in writing can be achieved with structured practice. By consistently trying to improve your writing, you will become a better writer. 

    An outline is an essential part of the writing process. Nevertheless, it is one that many writers overlook. More accurately, it is one that many writers ignore.
    An outline is an essential part of the writing process that many writers ignore.

Tip 5: Eliminate Unnecessary Uses of Which is and That

The phrase which is is frequently unnecessary and can often be omitted from a sentence without sacrificing any meaning.
Examples

    Katherine hates shopping during the Christmas season, which is the busiest shopping season of the year.
    Katherine hates shopping during the Christmas season, the busiest shopping season of the year.

    Paul’s favorite toy, which is a teddy bear, is beginning to fall apart.
    Paul’s favorite toy, a teddy bear, is beginning to fall apart.

That is another word sprinkled recklessly and unnecessarily over many pieces of writing. It is a writer’s nightmare to find every unnecessary instance of that after completing a work. Therefore, it’s best to monitor your usage as you write.
Examples

    Matt was surprised that Olivia agreed to dance with him.
    Matt was surprised Olivia agreed to dance with him. 

    The word that is abused so often that it eventually becomes an annoyance.
    The word that is abused so often it eventually becomes an annoyance.

Tip 6: Write in the Positive

Double negatives force your readers to uncoil otherwise simple sentences. Remember: Two negatives make a positive. Keep in mind, however, that double negatives often have a place in poetry and rhetoric.
Examples

    It wasn’t that Sam didn’t care about school. He just didn’t enjoy it.
    Sam cared about school but didn’t enjoy it.

    Katherine was not unconvinced by his argument.
    Katherine was convinced by his argument. 

    It was not uncommon for James to smoke a cigarette after work.
    It was common for James to smoke a cigarette after work. 

Tip 7: Use Punctuation Sparingly

Writers must be economical in more than their use of words, for words are only the building blocks of language. Writers must also be economical in their use of punctuation.

Like words, punctuation marks must be used sparingly and only when strictly necessary, because humans can only account for so much information at a time.

The more commas and semicolons you include in a sentence, the more knots you’re forcing the reader to unwind to grasp your message. Limit the number of punctuation marks in your writing for a cleaner, more effective piece of prose.
Examples

    Jonathan didn’t like reading; he thought it was a waste of time.
    Jonathan didn’t like reading because he thought it was a waste of time.

    Melody wanted to be either of two things: a nurse, or a dentist.
    Melody wanted to be either a nurse or a dentist.

    It soon became clear: Gary wasn’t his friend anymore.
    It soon became clear Gary wasn’t his friend anymore.

Tip 8: Prefer the Active Voice to the Passive Voice

As a rule of thumb, use the active voice for a cleaner, more powerful message.
What Is the Active Voice?

The active voice is direct and vigorous. In the active voice, the subject of a sentence performs the action.
Examples

    Martha kissed Gordon.
    The police are performing an investigation.
    The man waved to the little girl.

What Is the Passive Voice?

The passive voice is the active voice’s shy sister. In the passive voice, the subject receives the action.
Examples

    Gordon was kissed by Martha.
    An investigation is being performed by the police.
    The little girl was waved to by the man. 

When to Use Active Voice and Passive Voice

The active voice brings a sense of control and forcefulness to your writing. For this reason, it is often preferred in day-to-day writing and in journalism. The active voice is best used when answering a question, addressing an issue, or whenever candidness is your top priority.

    (Active) I didn’t eat breakfast yesterday.
    (Passive) Breakfast was not eaten by me yesterday.

    (Active) The child did not pull the fire alarm.
    (Passive) The fire alarm was not pulled by the child.

    (Active) Randy didn’t enjoy Sunday mornings.
    (Passive) Sunday mornings were not enjoyed by Randy. 

However, some writers make the mistake of avoiding the passive voice altogether. Doing this will make your writing sound monotonous, prescriptive, and downright awkward.

Do not be afraid to use the passive voice, for one voice is not decisively better than the other. The passive voice is best used when the writer wants to emphasize the recipient of the action, not the performer of the action.

    (Passive) This house was built by my grandfather.
    (Active) My grandfather built this house.

    (Passive) The building was engulfed by a fire.
    (Active) Fire engulfed the building.

    (Passive) The ball was caught by Tony.
    (Active) Tony caught the ball. 

Try these passive voice exercises for extra practice identifying the passive voice and rewriting sentences in the active voice.

8 Steps to More Concise Writing
By Mark Nichol

background image 269

You know you must streamline your writing, but the devil’s in the details. Here are some specifics about what to look for:
1. Remove Redundancy

Avoid double-teaming terms like “a period of one week,” “end result,” “free gift,” and “personal opinion.” Watch for phrases that echo the quality in question: “oval in shape,” “larger in size,” “shorter in duration,” and the like. Omit redundant words that are already implied as part of an abbreviated term, such as machine in “ATM machine.”
2. Reduce Phrases to Words

Replace a descriptive phrase following a noun with a one-word adjective that precedes the noun: “People who experienced at traveling know better than to label their luggage,” for example, can be revised to “Experienced travelers know better than to label their luggage.

A modifying phrase, similarly, can be reduced to a simple adverb: “Sympathizing with her concerns, he nodded in response to her complaint,” for instance, is more concisely expressed as “He nodded sympathetically in response to her complaint.”

Delete extraneous phrases such as “which is” and “who were,” as shown here: “We drove down Lombard Street, which is considered the crookedest street in the world” is easily simplified to “We drove down Lombard Street, considered the crookedest street in the world.”
3. Omit Gratuitous Intensifiers and Qualifiers

Use adverbs that intensify or qualify in moderation: “They had an extremely unpleasant experience” isn’t accurate unless a subsequent explanation justifies the intensifier extremely, and “I was somewhat taken aback” isn’t necessarily an improvement on “I was taken aback.”
4. Expunge Expletives

“There are” or “there is” is a weak way to start a sentence. “There is a telling passage toward the end of the story” lacks the focus of (and the more vivid verb in) the sentence “A telling passage occurs near the end of the essay.”
5. Negate Nominalizations

“The report gave an analysis of the accident” uses a phrase where a single word suffices. (This is known as a nominalization, or smothering a verb.) When you see a “(verb) a/an (noun)” construction, convert the noun into a verb and replace the phrase with it. In this case, “The report analyzed the accident” is the more concise result. As with deletion of expletives, a stronger verb is an additional benefit.
6. Delete Superfluous Phrases

“At the present time,” “for all intents and purposes,” and “in the event that” are just a few of many meaningless phrases that clutter sentences. Trim them to tighten your writing.
7. Avoid Cliches

Likewise, “face the music,” “litmus test,” “tried and true” and other timeworn phrases add nothing to your writing but words; they’re useful only for padding a word count, but instructors and editors (and readers) will notice.
8. Eschew Euphemisms

Generally, words that disguise concepts degrade language, which is all about expressing, not repressing, meaning. For example, “collateral damage,” in reference to warfare (and, by extension, to all interpersonal relationships), invites derision. However, use of some euphemisms, such as those for human disabilities, is a well-meaning effort to preserve the dignity of the disabled, though some people argue that such cosmetic wording actually harms people by diminishing the seriousness of their condition, or that it is for the benefit not of the disabled but of people who would rather not be reminded of the disabled.

Concise Communication Training: Five Key Tips to Write Concisely

Concise communication training is critical across every industry. Writing in business is all about word economy. Can you clearly communicate the exact message you intend in as few words as possible? It’s a lofty goal, but with the following writing tips, you’ll be well on your way to stronger, more concise writing! Here are our top five concise communication training tips:

concise communication training
Use active voice and action verbs. 

Concise communication training should always cover the importance of active voice and action verbs. Strong writing is often tailored to fit readers’ expectations that actors should come before the act. Active voice uses a “who did what” structure, but passive voice uses a “what was done by whom” structure. This means that even in their basic structure, active voice tends to be more concise than passive voice. One of the key ways you can transform your writing from passive voice into active voice is by using “action verbs” instead of “being verbs.” Being verbs usually start with “is,” “am,” “was,” “were,” “be,” “being,” “becoming,” or “are.” Instead of communicating action, they communicate existing or being.
Reduce nominalizations.

The word “nominalization” is a mouthful, and we wouldn’t bring it up unless it was super important to helping you write more concisely. A nominalization is a noun form of a verb. Remember, a noun as a person, place, or thing, and a verb as a part of speech that communicates action or state of being. A nominalization is a combination of a noun and a verb, and while nominalization do have a purpose—you shouldn’t strike them out of your writing toolkit altogether—you can make your writing more concise by cutting out nominalizations and using a more precise noun or verb instead. Here are some examples of nominalizations and their active verb counterparts: argument versus argue, behavior versus behave, dismissal versus dismiss, failure versus fail. Again, by simply using active verbs, you reduce your word count and make it easier for your readers to quickly digest more information.
Reduce adverbs. 

Adverbs are descriptors that describe a verb or the type of action that’s happening in the way that it’s happening. The easiest way to identify an adverb is to know that they typically end in the letters “ly.” Here’s a list of some of the most common adverbs out there: “always,” “anxiously,” “awkwardly,” “unexpectedly,” “rarely,” “frequently.” Oftentimes if you want to reduce word count and be more concise in your writing, you can cut out the adverbs altogether. They are usually the icing on the cake, and sometimes can get in the way of what you’re actually trying to say. Instead, try taking out the adverb and replacing it with a stronger verb. So instead of saying, “She speaks loudly,” you could say, “She shouts.”
Reduce prepositional phrases. 

When you think about prepositions, remember that their function is to show relationships and locations with regard to space and time. While communicating these relationships is important, some propositions can distract from who did what. The Chicago Manual of Style even recommends that you only include one preposition for every ten to 15 words. This highly specific recommendation exists because so many people overuse prepositions, and they often get in the way of concise writing. Luckily, you can simply replace the preposition with an apostrophe. Here’s an example: You might say, “The opinion of the CEO”—that might be your noun phrase. Instead of saying that, you can replace the preposition “of” with the apostrophe version of the noun, “the CEO’s opinion.”
Cut wordy phrases.

Sometimes less is more. Concise communication training should show professionals how to cut wordy phrases. Fewer words can actually show that you’re taking more time with your writing when you’re able to reduce its word count and really emphasize the most important information. There are commonly used wordy phrases that you can keep an eye out for so that you can substitute more concise alternatives. Here are some of our favorite common wordy phrases and better substitutes that reduce wordiness: “during the time that” can be substituted with “while,” “due to the fact that” can usually be substituted with “because,” “the question as to whether” can be substituted with just “whether.”

Remember, concision isn’t just about less words; concise communication training should empower you to write clearly first, and concisely second. Don’t compromise your readers’ understanding of the text. In other words, sometimes you need a preposition for the sake of clarity or style. Use your best judgment––and our five tips!
